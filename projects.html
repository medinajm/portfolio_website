        <h2>Message Generator</h2>
            <p>This script was one of my first attempts to write something, completely on my own, that did a small thing. It runs in Node, on the command line, and gives a quick pick-me-up if I'm feeling frustrated.</p>

        <h2>Mystery Organism</h2>
            <p>This project was an assignment from Codecademy. In order to compelete this project I used my knowledge of arrays, objects and loops in order to crate a factory function that creates DNA strands of a fictional orgnaism in order for my team to research them without needing a physical specimen. In the end the last function written creates specimens until you get 30 that have 60% of either "C" bases or "G" bases. See the full project code <a href="https://github.com/medinajm/mysteryOrganism">here</a></p>
        <h2>Whiskey Club Website</h2>
        <p>This was my first crack a a website using flexbox and grids. It is a fictional club for bourbon enthusiasts. See the source code <a href="">here</a>.</p>
        <p>You can see all of the source code to these as well as the rest of my repositories at <a href="https://github.com/medinajm">my gitHub page</a>.</p>
