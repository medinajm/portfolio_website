            <p>Hello, my name is Jeff Medina. I am an up and coming web developer and this is my portfolio.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="body" id="aboutMe">
            <p>I spent the majority of my life as an aspiring musician, starting at the age of eight. My teen years were filled with practice sessions, rehearsals and gigs of various types.  My undergraduate degree is in Music Performance where I studied classical and jazz trumpet (I always preferred jazz).  Getting that degree taught me the in's-and-out's of music's rich history from the baroque to the modern jazz greats, and the theory that ties it all together. It taught me patience and dedication. It taught me how to work as a team to achieve a common goal. More importantly though, it taught me how to focus and hone my craft. Hours and hours each day spent focusing on a singular goal.  Learning how to really do that, I wouldn't trade for anything.</p>
            <p>So now what then? What does all that have to with anything? Well...now I'm taking these skills and applying them to my next endeavor in life.  I've been coding for 5 months now and here is what I have to show thus far.  If you'd like to learn more, contact me <a href="./contactMe.html">here</a>.</p>
